I've had a computer for as long as I can remember. My parents were both into technology, so as soon as it was possible to have a PC in the house they did. I remember watching my dad tweak with the computer (either upgrading the hardware or just general use) and playing with things like Kid Pix to try and create fun things. Kid Pix was quite limited back then, but with a kid's imagination you really could make whatever you wanted. While Kid Pix and Mavis Beacon were enjoyable, and kept me distracted for a long time, eventually I lost interest. It wasn't until I was introduced to video games that I really got excited about what worlds computers would let people escape to.

I had been playing video games for awhile on the NES and SNES (mostly on the SNES), but it wasn't until I experienced _Age of Empires_ and _Diablo_ that my mind was truly blown. The, what seemed like, infinite possibilities of _Age of Empires_ and the ever-expanding world of _Diablo_ presented something that I never experienced before. Ever since then, games have been a mainstay of my lifeâ€”the way I stay in touch with old friends and how I make new friends. At this point, you may be wondering why I'm a web developer and not a game developer. Well, the interest in one seamlessly led into the other.
