I went to the Oregon Institute of Technology after touring the campus and realizing that it was the best place for me. I wanted to be taught in a hands-on environment so that I would be able to immediately apply anything I had learned in class to the real-world, which they delivered in spades. Since I had already taught myself C++ (the language that OIT teaches), I decided that I would take this opportunity to dual-major in hardware engineering to learn more about what happens under the hood.

During my time at OIT, I learned about how operating systems worked, the importance of design patterns, how CPUs actually process all of the data we throw at them, and how to structure applications so that they maintain their stability and ease of use. I also spent a large portion of time assisting the professors in their classes and labs as well as teaching C++ for a term the year that I graduated.
