I'm a 26 year-old developer currently living in Southern Oregon who loves to learn new things every day. I have been programming for over 10 years and have experience with the entire web stack, from mockups to server deployments. My interest in design started a couple of years ago when I decided that I wanted to broaden my skillset outside of programming. You can write the most beautiful, efficient code imaginable but if it's not presented in a clean, straight-forward way then your users aren't going to careâ€”this is yet another problem that I solve.
