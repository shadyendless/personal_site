If you've read everything up to here then you'll notice that I haven't had any formal training in web development or design. This almost entirely underscores who I am and what I doâ€”I am an autodidact trying to better myself so that I can help better those around me. I belive the ultimate reason that the web ended up grabbing my attention was because of the size of the audience and the impact of the platform.

I've mostly worked alone or in a small team (2-3 people) up to this point, and have worked on understanding as much as I can about the entire development process, from the design of a page to the servers and databases that will bring it to life, and up through the code to make it visible to the world.

Currently I am looking to help people bring their ideas to life, either as a freelance developer or as part of a larger team, as well as passing along the knowledge that I have acquired over the past decade of stalking books, the Internet, and school. If you have an idea you'd like to see realized or if I sound like someone you would like to work with, please get in touch and I look forward to talking with you!
