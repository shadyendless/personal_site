My parents and I have always played MMORPGs together, starting with _Ultima Online_ and playing everything through the _Final Fantasy XIV_. In 2002, while looking for our next world to immerse ourselves in, we came across _Final Fantasy XI_. There's not a concise way to explain the impact that _Final Fantasy XI_ had on my life, but if you'd like to talk more about it then I'd be more than willing. While playing _FFXI_ we formed a linkshell (you may be more familiar with the term guild or clan) and decided that we needed a website (this was the early 2000s, everyone had websites then). Nobody knew how to make anything and so I decided to step up and try. Enter Yahoo! GeoCities.

There's not a lot to say about Yahoo! GeoCities. It did exactly what it wanted to, and allowed me to create an awesome website for my group of friends. While GeoCities wasn't real development, it was enough to pique my interest in what more could be done. At this point my early interest in games started to crawl back (not playing them, but making them) and I thought, "Making a website is super easy, making a game should be just as easy, right"

Wrong. After researching what I would need to know to make games, I settled on learning C++. Understanding that I wouldn't be getting into games right away, I was content with just working through the basics. C++ is where I learned the majority of my basic-understanding of how programming works. I learned about variables, control structures, classes, pointers, memory management, everything that most other languages build upon. It was at this point that I tried to get my friends to learn C++ with me, I made a text adventure and hoped that they would think it was so cool they couldn't refuse. As you can imagine, none of them caredâ€”C++ isn't pretty. You know what is pretty, though? Websites.

Not wanting everything I had taught myself to go to waste, I began looking for ways to use my C++ knowledge to make websites. I couldn't find anything that was helpful, but I did come across C# and something called ASP.NET. C# looked familiar enough to me after learning C++ that I quickly picked it up and decided that it was going to be what I focused on. I went by TheASPKid for awhile but decided to drop it when I started college.
